Perl
====

Perl is the scripting language used for LON-CAPA at Purdue.

It is a general purpose, dynamically typed language known for both its flexibility and its ugliness. Hence, when using Perl, it is important to make use of the powerful features that the language offers while also writing clean, concise code that is easy for others to understand and maintain.

This manual scratches the surface of Perl and introduces basic features of the language. Using these features (and clear thinking), it should be possible to write good, efficient Perl for any LON-CAPA problem.
