# LON-CAPA Manual

A manual for authoring in LON-CAPA.

This manual focuses on creating math problems using Perl scripting and the Maxima computer algebra system. It does not go into great detail about web development, nor does it explain Python scripting or the R computer algebra system, as Perl and Maxima are primarily used at Purdue University where I work.
